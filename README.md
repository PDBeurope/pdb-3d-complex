The PDB 3D complex is a server that analyses the complexes in crystal structures. This component gives a compact summary of the results for a particular PDB code and assembly. Selecting ‘more details’ gives further information based on the 3D Complex prediction and clicking on the ‘Evidence’ text links out to the server for further information.
